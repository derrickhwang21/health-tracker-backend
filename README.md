# Codefellowship
Building an Android health tracker app. The features are built out over the next several labs.

This repository features server work for the project: [Health-Tracker Android Application](https://github.com/derrickhwang21/health-tracker)

## Feature Task

##### Backend
Add a replica of your Exercise model to the backend Spring app. Create a POST route that allows creating a new Exercise, and a GET route that responds with all Exercises currently in the database. Test these routes with Postman, deploy, and ensure there’s at least one Exercise in your deployed db. (This is all easy now… right?)


## Changelog
